# Teach Me How to Write Like This (30)

## Problem

My friend Michelle found this cool new site, but you have to pay to read and she doesn't have money. Can you help her read the [fics](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/fandoms/index.html) anyways?

## Hint

Where can you find out what files are in a server?
