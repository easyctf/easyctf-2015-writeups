# Wastebin 1 (90)

## Problem

I created a paste-sharing site the other day. Since client-side is faster, I decided to retrieve the entire database and store it client-side. No one should be able to see it, right? Prove me wrong by finding the admin password. [page](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/wastebin-1/index.html)

## Hint

What's wrong with storing things on the client's browser?
